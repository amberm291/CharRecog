Requirements to run this code-
1. openCV
2. PIL
3. numpy, scipy

The code can classify only three characters right now. The images are also given for the training and testing set.
Keep the training and testing folders in the same directory as the code or else specify the full path in the code of these folders.
Due to the feature vector not being normalised, the regularisation parameter lambda(variable lam in the code) is set to 100. Change it to get varied results.
